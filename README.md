### What is libft?
The [Libft][1] is a library in the context of the [1337][2] school's curriculum. The 1337 school is a coding school known for its rigorous and project-based approach to learning programming. The "libft" stands for "library functions" and is a project that students at 1337 school are typically required to complete.
In the libft project, students are tasked with creating their own implementation of various standard C library functions. These functions include common operations such as string manipulation, memory allocation, character handling, Data Structure Manipulation, and more. The goal of the project is to familiarize students with the inner workings of these fundamental functions and to reinforce their understanding of the C programming language.

By completing the libft project, students gain a deeper understanding of how these functions work and develop their skills in writing efficient and reliable code. The resulting libft library can then be used in other projects throughout the 1337 school's curriculum.
